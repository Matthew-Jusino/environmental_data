## Loading Data and Packages

You can use the require or library fucntions to retrieve packages you want to work with.

```{r}
require(here)
require(palmerpenguins)
```

Using the 'here' and 'read.csv' functions, we can read the data contained in a csv into a new data frame

```{r}
ginkgo = read.csv(here("data", "ginkgo_data_2021.csv"))
```
